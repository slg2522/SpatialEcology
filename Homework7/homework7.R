##Homework 7 – Analyzing animal movements
##Handout 21 November 2022
##Due Friday 5 December 2022
##Adult female leatherback turtles were Argos satellite tagged off Playa Grande,
##Costa Rica, in the Pacific Ocean. These tracks have been filtered to remove
##spurious locations and regularized to give daily positions as latitudes and
##longitudes (decimal degrees). In  the Week 13 homework folder on the Google
##drive you will find these daily position data files for each of five tracked
##leatherback turtles (ID 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8) named in the format
##“LeatherbackTurtle_ID1_DataForStudents.csv”. Use these data to complete the
##following tasks and questions for each individual tracked turtle:
  
##1. Map the track of each leatherback turtle.
##It can be five separate maps for each individual or all five tracks plotted
##on one map with a legend.







##2. Plot step length versus frequency on logarithmic scales for each
##leatherback turtle track.







##3. For each turtle ID, does the distribution of step lengths fit a Lévy
##flight model distribution?





  
  
##4. Calculate the median and maximum speeds for each turtle track
##(where speeds>0).






##5. Plot the net squared displacement for each turtle track (solid black line),
##the expected net squared displacement for a correlated random walk (CRW, black 
##dashed line), and for a biased random walk (BRW, gray dashed line) using the
##step lengths, turning angles and bearing from each track’s distribution. There
##should be one graph for each track (five graphs total).






##6. For each turtle ID, did they fit a correlated random walk, a biased random
##walk model, or neither?
  



  
##7. What do these results suggest about the turtles’ behavior during this
##tracking period? (A couple of sentences is fine)
